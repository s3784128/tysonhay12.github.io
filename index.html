								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> My name is Tyson Hay, my student number is s3784128 and my email address is thay4561@gmail.com. I was born in Melbourne and I’m fully Australian (maybe a little too Australian). The highest level of education I have completed is the VCE, as I am fresh out of high school. I only speak English but did learn French for about 7 years at school (can barely remember how to speak it). Some interesting facts about myself are that I like to longboard when I can, I play football for the Templestowe FC and my favourite colour is green.</a></p>

				                                <span><img src="assets/Screenshot_3.png" alt="" /></span>
				                                <p> What do the results of these tests mean to me?
				                                <br> These results don’t surprise me much as I already have realised that I exhibit the traits they explained. Although, I do see this as an effective tool for learning new ways to study and to allow students like myself to discover how they will study best to make the most out of the way they learn.</p>
				                                <p> How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?
								<br> These results would influence my behaviour as from the results, it revealed that I was good in social situations, this therefore being a skill needed for project work as without effective communication, a group project would not be completely to a high standard. On the other hand, as the Myers-Briggs test revealed that I am a “debater” this may bring some conflicts to a group if we do not all agree on a topic, with this maybe causing arguments.</p>
				                                <p> How should I take this into account when forming a team?
								<br> I will take this information into account by finding like minded people in my class who exhibit similar traits, so that we have achieve well together because if we all learn the same way, then we will be able to help each other out better than an having an auditory learner trying to help out a visual learner, as their methods may not be as helpful.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I’ve always had an interest in IT since I was a young kid, always having a curiosity whenever our family would get new devices or other technology. Currently, I’m not entirely sure what field of IT I’m most interested in, but that’s why I’ve come to RMIT as I am keen to discover what interests me most. I originally became interested in IT as a child when my mum would be setting up something like a new computer, and I would just be curious to how to set it up. This has now led to me being the family’s first person to ask for help whenever something new needs to be installed, being either new software or hardware. </p>
								<h2 class="major">Why did I choose RMIT?</h2>
								<p>I chose to go RMIT for a few reasons. One of them is because of the great facilities RMIT has, as so far its been great to use the facilities RMIT provides to there students. Another reason was because its easy to take public transport to from my area, as other university aren’t as easy to get to. I also got several recommendations from friends that RMIT was the university that I should go to.</p>
								<h2 class="major">What do I expect to learn?</h2>
								<p>I expect to learn a fair amount about IT and computer science in general during my time at RMIT. From just the first few weeks, I can tell that I’m going to learn a lot regarding coding and the different languages used. I also expect to learn the fundamentals of information technology and how it is used everywhere around the world.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<span><img src="assets/Screenshot_1.png" alt="" /></span> 
								<p>I believe that having the job of being an IT Project Manager would be a rewarding and exciting career that I wish one day I would either have, or capable of obtaining.  Being an IT Project Manager involves managing large IT projects with businesses, which could include upgrading and improving a business’ whole IT system. The job itself can vary a fair bit, but it would involve creating project plans, managing budgets, creating good relationships with stakeholders and setting key milestones for the project. This career appeals to me as I wish to obtain a career with some sort of authority in the future and being able to complete a big project for a important company would be quite an enjoyable feeling after all the hard work that would need to be done. As I also like to problem solve in the current aspects of my life, I feel that this sort of career would heavily involve problem solving. The skills needed to work in this line of work would include excellent planning, time management, problem solving and interpersonal skills. The qualifications and experience needed to be an IT Project Manager would be a least a bachelor level degree in IT (some sort of advanced degree in management would also be preferred), a fair amount of experience working on IT projects and also being an IT professional for a decent amount of time would definitely be preferred by employers. Currently, I do not have any of the qualifications needed to even get close to working in this career, but hopefully I can achieve them in the next decade of my life. My current qualifications consist of achieving the VCE and an RSA (Responsible Service of Alcohol) so clearly, I have a lot of work ahead of me to get to a point where this career would be obtainable. My plans to achieve these qualifications are to finish my bachelor’s degree at RMIT, to then working in the IT industry as much as possible, and then would be to complete a management course of some kind so that I can work in as an IT Project Manager.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
								<p> Overview 
								<br> The project I wish to make is a smartphone rostering app that could be used to make the rostering system at a business better than just a paper system. This would allow employees to easily change shifts if they are unavailable to work, while also giving other employees a fair chance to pick up the shift, as this would notify them through the app. This would also show the full schedule for each week, which would help employees remember when they are working.</p>
								<p> Motivation 
								<br> My motivation behind this idea is that my current workplace, Templestowe IGA, the rostering system is inefficient and slightly unfair as casual workers like myself can rarely pick up extra shifts as the shifts are usually already taken by the part time employees because the system is dependant on whoever luckily sees it first in the office. I do not expect that this software would be used, but if I manage to develop it to a high standard, there is a chance it may be adopted by my employers. This would also get a positive response from the other employees who also go to university, as we have agreed that the current system does not allow us to obtain the number of shifts that we should be getting (life’s definitely my expensive after finishing high school). </p>
								<p> Description 
								<br> The application would include options to swap shifts, get shifts covered, give a whole weekly schedule and giving notifications to the devices. It would have a simple interface with large text/buttons so that is easily usable by all employees, regardless how tech savvy they are. The notifications would be quite integral to the application as it would be the first way to notify employees when they are able to take new shifts. There should be the option to apply for long holiday periods, making it easily for the managers to know when employees will be unavailable in the long term. It would be developed so it could be used on both iOS and Android so that regardless of the device used, every employee could use it. The application shouldn’t be too flashy and colourful as I believe not all employees will wish to use it if its too complicated.  </p>
								<p> Tools and Technology 
								<br> From some research, it appears that I will need to install how to use app development software, such as one software I found called Firebase which helps with development of real-time scheduling applications. I will use my laptop and RMIT desktops to develop my application. </p>
								<p> Skills Required 
								<br> The skills required would be a much better understanding on HTML coding, while also needing to learn coding in AngularJS or CSS (languages similar or based on HTML). </p>
								<p> Outcome
								<br> If this project is successful, it would result in a more effective and efficient rostering system for my workplace, therefore leading to better employee satisfaction. This would solve the issue of casual workers not getting enough shifts and allowing employees to request for a shift to be covered/swapped without needing to go into the workplace. Although, I expect for my employers to allow this software to be used, it would need to look professional and easily usable for also the older/less tech savvy employees (not trying to sound rude, but the paper system is preferred by the older employees as I believe they do not want to adopt new technology). </p>
